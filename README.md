# COVID-19 Exploration
Covid-19 exploration data analysis project! In this project, I performed the task of exploring the COVID-19 dataset containing data from 2020-04-24 to 2022-05-29. I worked on this project to gain insights on how the virus affected the population and how the vaccine acted upon the virus. I used only SQL to derive insights from this dataset
